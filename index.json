I’ll be peppering in some maps that I’ve made to help illustrate my general thought process.\nWhen can we expect all this to wrap-up?\rFirst and foremost, there’s a chance that we’ll know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, who the winner of the electoral college vote will be by about 9 PM. That chance goes up if we push the deadline ’till 1 AM. But there’s also a solid chance that we won’t know for a few days to a week. Honestly, I’m not comfortable betting on which I think will happen.\nJust so we’re all on the same page: That doesn’t mean there’s a snowball’s chance in Hell that we’ll know the vote totals by the end of the night. We never actually know the totals for all of the states by the time election night bleeds into national political hangover day. Many states (like Alaska and California) are notoriously slow with counting their ballots–and the vast majority of other states spend a few days curing problematic ballots and/or allowing ballots post-marked prior to Election day to filter in. (Military votes are in a similar situation.) We won’t see validated totals for weeks after.\nThat’s how it is with every election. However, in normal times, we’ve gotten pretty good at using a combination of exit-polls and vote totals scraped from state/county election officials’ sites to project the eventual winner.\nAs you might have recognized, we are not in normal times.\n\rWhat’s the hold-up.\rIn a word: Pennsylvania.\nThrough a combination of COVID-19 and general anxiety/enthusiasm catalyzed by the last four years of President Trump’s tenure, we saw mind-bogglingly high levels of early/mail-in voting. At least 100 million people voted early this year, according to estimates from Michael McDonald’s US Elections Project. That translates to 73% of the nation’s 2016 vote total. Some states surpassed their 2016 totals.\nHowever, not all states have laws that allow them to tabulate early ballots as they come in. This map from Pew Research shows which states tabulate the votes as they come in.\n\r\rThe state throwing the biggest monkey-wrench into the works is undoubtedly Pennsylvania. For reasons that I’ll get to in a second, Pennsylvania is critical to President Trump’s pathway to victory. Without it, he has very little chance of making it into office. Complicating things more is that Pennsylvania counts day-of votes first before the early vote. It could take days before the early vote totals are cleared. And given that Joe Biden appears to be leading quite dramatically among early voters, according to the polls, there is a solid chance that President Trump will appear to be leading in the state by the end of the night. If Joe Biden is winning PA by sunrise tomorrow—barring any irregularities in the day-of counting or insanely long lines—then he’s most likely won the election. (Even with the curse of daylight savings pushing daybreak an hour earlier.)\n\rHow Do I See the Election Turning Out?\rHere is what I see as the most likely outcome when everything is said and done. (From here on out, I’ll largely be using maps I’ve generated via 270 to Win.)\n\r\rI should caution that by “most likely”, I mean that I think this has somewhere between a 20-30% chance of it happening. There’s a better chance than not that I’m gonna be wrong—so don’t set your clock to it.\n(Another daylight savings joke. I’m still not over it. Now that I’m a father to a newborn, I can’t even begin to fathom how my parents managed this BS.)\nMany of these states are seen as toss-ups: Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. I settled on the answers that I did largely by taking these states, case-by-case, and thinking about how they performed over the last few elections, including 2018 and 2016, and their current political momentum. Here’s an abbreviated look at my rationale:\n\rArizona: Long-term trend towards purple, favoring Red; generally unfavorable to Trump and Trumpism in particular; 2018 strong showing for Democrats + strong polling.\rFlorida: Purple for a long time; recent history of Blue on Presidential races; super tight midterm.\rGeorgia: Solid red in Presidential contests; maintained Red in midterms; getting closer but still a red state in the south.\rIowa: Swingy the last couple decades, but a consistent polling lead for Trump.\rMaine-2: Generally weak right as is; fairly large disdain for Trumpism; consistent Biden Lead (albeit small).\rNebraska-2: Consistent polling lead for Biden.\rNorth Carolina: Swingy; solid 2018 performance; consistent advantage for Biden in Polling\rOhio: The supposed king-maker. Consistent Trump advantage in the polling; solid Republican performance in 2018.\rTexas: Gradual demographic transition to purple accelerated by Trump. It’d be bat-💩 crazy if it went from stalwart Red to true purple within a single cycle.\r\rWhich states I’m most likely to be wrong about.\rThe states I’m most likely to get wrong are probably Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Maine-2. I think Maine-2 will be a decent indicator of how well the GOP’s senate chances will fair though; if that goes Blue, Collins is probably toast and any hopes that incumbents will be insulated from down-ballot effects stemming from Trump most likely go out the window. I’m less bullish on the senate flipping than others, but that will be a fair indicator of a bad night for the GOP all around.\n\r\rBiden Pathways to victory\rBiden has a strong wall\rThe reason I’m as bullish as I am for Biden (besides the appeal of the alliteration) is that the current toss-ups can literally all break for President Trump and Biden would still win—provided there aren’t any major surprises in the polling.\n\r\rNot all of these states are equal with regards to the President’s chances. No state’s return is independent of the others—if Biden won Texas, that means we’re looking at a bona fide blue malestrom, let alone a wave—but some states give more information about how other states are going to break than others. FiveThirtyEight has a tool that uses the correlations among polling errors to show how a victory in some states ripples out to signal what’s happening in others. A Trump win in Georgia doesn’t shift things much, nor does one in Texas, because frankly it’s a shock that they’re even in play. A win in Florida, however, drastically lowers Biden’s chances and suggests a map that looks like the one above. However, even in that case, the President is still not favored to win if only for the fact that Biden is still leading in the Electoral college.\nThe upshot however is that if Trump loses any of those states, his only path to victory lies in there being large, unprecedented degrees of polling error.\rI know, I know. Some of you might be thinking: “But Peter! The polls in 2016…” to which I will reply (for what I pray to all that is good and holy is the last time) that even the state level polls did reasonably well in 2016 in the aggregate—and more pollsters have been doing more high quality state-level polls than last time. There have also been adjustments across the industry to account for the biggest systematic source of polling error in 2016, which was not properly accounting for Trump’s support among White, non-college educated voters.\n\r\rBiden’s best case(s)\rThe best case scenario for Biden is that he picks-up all of the toss-ups. But I should really emphasize that I don’t think this is a particularly likely outcome.\n\r\rA more realistic “great day” scenario for Biden is that he wins picks up Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia while Trump gets Texas, Ohio, and Iowa.\n\r\rJudging from the correlations in polling errors, Florida will be a good (but not perfect) indicator of how Georgia and North Carolina go. (Georgia could be called first but that doesn’t necessarily mean that Florida will go with it; the leverage one state has over another is asymmetric. For example: North Carolina going red/blue means less for Texas’ eventual outcome than Texas going red/blue means for North Carolina.) Ohio will probably provide a good (but, again, not perfect) indication for how the other three states will break.\n\r\rTrump Pathways to victory\rWithout Pennsylvania\rJust because I expect the President to lose doesn’t mean I think his loss is inevitable. But it’s tough. Really tough. And it’s made all the tougher because he’s currently not favored in Pennsylvania. And by “not favored in Pennsylvania” I mean that The Economist is giving Biden a 95% chance of carrying the state. Trump will have to outperform the polls by a strong margin to carry the day. The most likely states, given the margin of error for the most recent state level polls, is Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine-2 and Nebraska-2. That will give Trump 270 votes in the Electoral College.\n\r\rBut I want to stress how unlikely that is. Many of these wins are not all that correlated with each other—meaning that a win in any of them early on doesn’t necessarily portend a Biden defeat. (Other state combinations are also possible, but we’d be talking about even less likely polling errors.)\n\rWith Pennsylvania\rA trump victory in Pennsylvania dramatically improves the President’s chances. If the President wins there, it’s likely that he’s winning in a lot of other places that he’s currently not favored. However,it should be noted that even then he’d still need to pick up every one of the toss-up states. That can be helped by the fact that winning Pennsylvania would suggest a large degree of errors in the polls. But that degree of error is, I have to emphasize, really improbable. This outcome isn’t necessarily less likely than the one above, but pulling-off Pennsylvania would be an incredible upset. And, honestly, I would probably need to seriously reevaluate my life choices should it happen: especially my chosen profession.\n\r\rThe other point to consider when weighing out the importance of Pennsylvania is just how long that would make the contest. Basically, if Trump wins every toss-up state, then we’re not going to know the election’s outcome until about the end of the week at earliest. Because, as mentioned above, Pennsylvania counts their early votes last and haven’t started counting them at all. If Trump is ahead by the end of the night, we’ll just have to wait and see if the Biden advantage banked-up from early voting is enough. (Although, as a Floridian, I must confess that it’ll be nice to have all of the attention away from us for once.)\nIn short, in order for the President to win, he’s going to have to pull-off one helluva upset. That doesn’t make it impossible (upsets happen all the time) but, by definition, it makes it unlikely.\r\r\r\rCool. But what if Trump doesn’t leave?\rI can understand the concern some have that Trump won’t leave given that, for the first time in American history, a President has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power. If he refuses to concede the election, we’ll be in an unprecedented situation in our country. (And, yes, I’m including 1876 because there wasn’t an incumbent involved with that colossal cluster f*ck.)\nHowever, being unprecedented here at home doesn’t mean unprecedented abroad. The last few decades are unfortunately replete with examples of democratic states backsliding into either competitive or outright authoritarianism. And there are lessons to be learned there. Namely, a Trump coup is unlikely to be fruitful if he doesn’t have the support of key power brokers in the Government as well as in the Military. And I frankly don’t think Trump has that support.\nWhen it comes to Congressional Republicans, while they certainly have acquiesced to large expanses in executive power—and excused a number of insane controversies—they have, to their credit, largely rebuked the President when he made suggestions that are unequivocally undemocratic (such as moving election day or not peacefully conceding an electoral loss.) McConnell’s support of the President seems to extend only as far as the latter been able to reliably install conservative judges into the federal judiciary. I’m not saying that we should sleep on the possibility that McConnell and the rest turn out to be entirely without scruples and little-d democratic principles. But I am saying that we shouldn’t necessarily buy-in to the idea that they’ll do such open, incontrovertibly authoritarian moves.\nAdditionally, Trump would need the support of the Military. Looking at how they responded to his attempts to deploy troops during the height of the protests earlier this year, I feel more confident saying that he doesn’t have it. Additionally, 200 retired generals, including a few who served under Trump, endorsed Biden. I’m not saying that this means the entire current membership of the higher brass does, too—but Trump’s support would need to be far more consolidated than it appears to be.\nI think it’s quite likely that Trump will be a petulant child up until Joe Biden is sworn in. It would be, without a doubt, the most bonkers lame-duck period in modern American history. But I think that, if he loses the election, there’s a far better chance that he leaves than him fighting to stay.\n(A more likely issue was/is Trump stealing the election. However, a number of important lower and Supreme Court decisions over the last few weeks—even those posed to conservative justices—have largely come back against the GOP plaintiffs. The President has been open about his hopes that the election will be close so that they can be litigated in the courts. But there seems to be a better chance that it’s not close enough for them to entertain all of the challenges he and his team have cooked up.)\n\rSo does a Biden win mean that American democracy is safe?\rahahhahahahahhahahhahhahhaha\nOh.\nWere you serious?\nahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah * laughs start breaking down into sobs *\nI think American democracy is in peril. I don’t think that’s necessarily a controversial position among those who study democratic regimes and how they degrade. But I don’t think that Joe Biden is going to single-handidly (or even jointly, with Kamala Harris and/or a unified Democratic government) save the country.\nI’ll probably write (or record) more about this later so I won’t give it all away now: But we’re going to need to see governmental reforms the likes of which we haven’t seen since the post-Watergate Congress. We’re going to need that and a major overhaul in our media environment and strengthening of our critical institutions and a lot of elite coordination and cooperation across both sides of the political spectrum and a public shift in what conduct we do and don’t condone, see as civil and uncivil, as acceptable and unacceptable. None of it has to be resolved day one, or even within Biden’s tenure, but we need to make serious progress in these areas. There is no other option. Because our political momentum, in this current moment, does not bode well; our trajectory follows a well-worn path into authoritarianism and there are dispiriting few junctures remaining to veer off of it.\nI don’t think it’s impossible. I am ever the optimist—if only for my own sanity. But the work has only just begun. And it must be done even if I’m wrong and Biden loses.\nIf I’m being honest, especially then.\n\r","date":1604361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613363930,"objectID":"7608f5bcacd2773380df416ceace62f8","permalink":"/post/some-thoughts-about-the-2020-election/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/some-thoughts-about-the-2020-election/","section":"post","summary":"I thought I would post my prediction for the election and a few thoughts regarding it more generally.

The average player racks up an average of 7 hours a week and the industry hauls in billions of dollars a year. Despite decades of moral panic and hand-wringing that video games are corrupting the civic values of American youth, very little research has been done to actually see how games influence political behaviors: specifically, our attitudes and tendencies to participate in politics. This dissertation uses a mixture of quantitative and qualitative analyses to argue that certain game experiences\u0026mdash;those that make players think about social, moral, and political issues as well as those that strengthen social ties\u0026mdash;can affect political attitudes and inspire players to be more active in politics.\nThe dissertation uses a mix of survey data, archival work, content analysis, and randomized controlled experimentation to present 4 main arguments:\n  Just like any other narrative medium, games tell stories to their consumers; stories that often concern or contain things that are relevant to our society at large. These stories are known to engender effects to our political behaviors when presented in the format of the news, movies, television shows, and novels. In this respect games are no different.\n  Unlike those other forms of media, though, games are far more interactive. The player is acting upon their experiences in ways that they can\u0026rsquo;t with other media. They are active agents in these worlds. The socially, morally, and politically relevant content is often contingent or can otherwise be linked to the actions that players perform via their avatars. And the behaviors they practice and perform behind the screen can have ramifications beyond it.\n  But the effects of games are not limited to their content: video games have always been social experiences. They encouraging new relationships and strengthen those that already exist. We know that, generally, these behaviors lead to increased political action\u0026mdash;and this dissertation argues that the networks established around games are no different. They also lead to increased activity through the creation and maintenance of social capital as well as increasing the opportunities people have to be exposed to political talk.\n  These effects are not haphazard. Game designers consciously put relevant content into their games and strive for their multiplayer experiences to create feelings of community. And they (treatments sociopolitical issues and multiplayer opportunities) can be readily found in the vast majority of the most popular games released from 2007\u0026ndash;2017. And these effects are not rare or uncommon. Gaming is not just for the young, awkward, and/or antisocial. Nearly 2 out every 5 Americans play games that engage with sociopolitical issues\u0026mdash;and more play games socially with friends.\n  Games, in short, matter\u0026mdash;in a lot of ways and for a lot of people. This dissertation provides one of Political Science\u0026rsquo;s first look into how and why.\n","date":1603756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603756800,"objectID":"d6e1afc3aa2498ea92c8a653009f4337","permalink":"/project/dissertation/","publishdate":"2020-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dissertation/","section":"project","summary":"The Effects of Video Games on Political Behavior","tags":["Dissertation","Video Games","Political Participation","Political Attitudes"],"title":"Press B to March (Dissertation)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601164800,"objectID":"835ee6394eb2dfcb9eb6976895b35f23","permalink":"/project/write-in-deadlines/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/write-in-deadlines/","section":"project","summary":"Video","tags":["Data Visualization"],"title":"Write-in Requirements for the 2020 election","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Inspired by all of the chaos and craziness that was mail-in and drop-off voting in the 2020 election, my students from my 2020 Election Data Science class and I created an app designed to help people find ballot-drop-off and early voting locations.

I wanted to figure out how many of each class was listed within a variable. Easy enough with group_by() in normal circumstances. Unfortunately, the purveyors of this dataset decided to name their columns with two words. So something like tasty fruit rather than tasty-fruit or tasty_fruit. Unfortunately, just passing the multi-word name through group_by() as you normally would a standard column name won’t work for reasons I detail below.\nTLDR: There are two solutions. Click here for solution 1 and here for solution 2.\nNow, there are a lot of different conventions for naming columns in a dataset: camelCase, TitleCase, snake_case, mEmEcAsE1—but one thing that is pretty universally avoided among data analytics professionals (aside from using the same name twice), it’s using multiple words for one column name. The reasons are part historical, part technological—but many languages (R included) don’t play nice with column names containing spaces. But, it’s still an issue that can crop-up from time-to-time, so I thought I would share my solution to it.\n(Note: I’m generally understanding if the source isn’t an analyst or is someone who, like, only works with smaller excel files and (some) SQL variants. But I’m convinced that there’s only one way to deal with the “pros” who do this: Ritual sacrifice to the coding gods.)\n\rThe only logical path.\r\rHere’s how you group by variables with spaces in them using dplyr.\rI’m going to be using the penguins dataset to demonstrate.\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) #For Data\rlibrary(magrittr) #For pipes\rlibrary(dplyr) #For data manipulation\rhead(penguins)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 8\r## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_~ body_mass_g sex ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;\r## 1 Adelie Torge~ 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male ## 2 Adelie Torge~ 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema~\r## 3 Adelie Torge~ 40.3 18 195 3250 fema~\r## 4 Adelie Torge~ NA NA NA NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 5 Adelie Torge~ 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema~\r## 6 Adelie Torge~ 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male ## # ... with 1 more variable: year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\rLet’s say I want to know how many different kinds of penguins there are.

This is something that Qualtrics can do really easily with its in-built randomizer function. If you use this, and keep evenly present elements on, your respondents will be sorted in roughly evenly. So if you have 16 respondents and 4 groups, on average you’ll get 4 people per group.\n\r\rBut we had a different situation. We had four groups but we didn’t want it split evenly. We wanted it so that group 1 was half of the survey, and groups 2, 3, and 4 took up thirds of the remaining half.\n\r\rUnfortunately, Qualtrics doesn’t seem to have an option that let’s you select unequal probabilities natively. If you deselect “evenly present elements” it’ll just randomize without any real concern towards whether your groups end up looking roughly equal. But that’s not what we needed. So I wanted to write about our solution to this so, hopefully, others in a similar situation might be able to find a work-around that works for them, too!\nOur solution used embedded data, then branches, and the standard randomizer. I’ll also talk about how you might be able to generalize this to any number of conditions (although some are more work than others).\nStarting with Embedded Data\rAs you probably know: After you’re done with your Qualtrics survey, you can export it as a csv or as a xlsx file. In addition to the answers to your questions, it’ll also include some project and respondent metadata. But you can also program the survey for it to include you’re own custom metadata to be embedded in the project. You can do this by clicking on the “add new element here” button and adding embedded data to the project.\n\r\rOnce you’ve done that, you can customize your field to have whatever name you want. You can also set the value for this field. Here I set a variable named “test” equal to the value “1”. When I export the results for this survey, there will be a new column called “test” where the value for every respondent will be 1.\nImportantly, though, you can also set multiple conditions for the embedded data field! You do this by clicking “add below” and adding more embedded data sections.\nPop quiz! What would you get in the “test” column if you ran this survey as is?\nYou’d get 4 because, right now, you’re telling Qualtrics:\n\rInvent a column called test. Set it equal to 1.\rActually, remember test? Set it to 2.\rI lied. Make it 3 now.\rJk. 4.\r\rHere’s where we start using the randomizer.\n\r“OMG so random…”\rAs it stands now, you’re going to end up with a field called test where the value is set to 3 for all respondents. Instead of that, we can use the randomizer to make it so that 1/4 of the sample has a value of 1 for test, 1/4 has a value of 2, 1/4 has a value of 3, and 1/4 has a value of 4.\nYou may be thinking “Cool. But this doesn’t do anything for me. I’m right back at equal probabilities for my experimental conditions.” And you’d be right if we were stopping here.\nBut we’re not stopping here.\nWe’re going to nest randomization conditions.\rThis programming is pretty similiar to what we ended up using. Let’s follow the logic of the flow:\nRandomly pick either the test 1 condition with 50 % probability.\rIf it is not picked, then randomly select one of the remaining 3 conditions with 1/3 probability each.\r\rThis will mean that half of the respondents will get test1 and 1/6th will go to each test2, test3, and test4. Which is what the situation is in the second image and exactly what we were looking for in the real-life scenario.\nThis nesting is the key thing here. By nesting your randomizers strategically, there are few combinations that you won’t be able to achieve. This sort of set up can be really useful if you’re doing a multifactorial survey experiment.\nWe can wrap this all up with a neat bow through some branching.\n\r\rBranch it out\rNow we can do some branches so that our participants only see the blocks that they’re intended to see. Then branches work off of boolean logic. If a condition is TRUE then it’ll run a particular course of action. If it’s FALSE then it won’t run that action. In Qualtrics, you can set the branching logic so that it reflects the metadata that was assigned to participants through the randomizer.\nAfter that, you can add the block that you wanted people with test condition 1 (and only test condition 1) to see. And if you repeat it out, then you can complete the whole survey flow. Here’s basically what our survey looked like once the logic is completed all the way to the end.\nOne of the things I really like about this approach (rather than, say, using a random number generator and a bunch of then branches) is that this makes your later analysis pretty easy. If you’re making pivot tables, you can group off of that variable’s value. If you’re doing ANOVA in SPSS, Stata, or R, you’ve got a single variable already to go without having to do any post-hoc coding. It also makes it easier to set dummy variables if you do a more advanced regression analysis. I’m personally a big fan of doing small-to-moderate amounts of work up-front to save myself larger amounts of work down the road.

I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on writing a longer review because I didn\u0026rsquo;t really write any notes. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take notes. Not because it was bad, but because I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to peel my eyes away from the page for the short seconds it\u0026rsquo;d take for me to grab my pen and notebook. I was too engrossed to want to do anything but live in its pages for however long it\u0026rsquo;d let me. So, no review\u0026mdash;but maybe that ardor could stand in place of one.\nBut aside from just being human, well-written, and the right mix of cynical and optimistic, it is also just an eminently and endlessly quotable book. There are quotes here that I plan on using when I talk about machine learning in my upcoming data science class. Quotes that just stabbed me in the chest with self-recognition (cough cough Miranda being a workaholic cough cough). And then there are quotes that make me feel that Green is one of the few science fiction authors who actually understand the sociology and psychology of being a practicing scientist (which, ya know, SciShow and his M.S.\u0026mdash;so it makes sense). But then there\u0026rsquo;s this quote near the end of the book that so perfectly described being a survey researcher that it made me laugh out loud:\n [We wanted to] dive deep into our survey responses. Except there were just too many\u0026hellip;no matter how we filtered, there just wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good way.\n  April and I were griping about this around the black marble countertop in the kitchen when Carl came in and overheard us.\n  \u0026ldquo;Just do a search,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n  \u0026ldquo;The searches take forever and we don\u0026rsquo;t know what to search for,\u0026rdquo; April replied. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of dumb data. Most of the useful stuff is in text responses, which is impossible to parse.\u0026quot;\n I loved and loathed the reductionism of \u0026ldquo;dumb data\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;mostly because it\u0026rsquo;s right. Until we data geeks make the decisions on what to model, how to model it, and how to frame and embed our results into a digestable narrative, it is literally just that. Dumb data, (sometimes) intelligently collected. And also, it\u0026rsquo;s so, so spot-on to note that almost all of the really juicy stuff is in the open-ended responses where people just let you know what\u0026rsquo;s actually going on. Or at least their inwardly-biased interpretation of their messy cognitive processes\u0026mdash;which is still super cool and really interesting!\nAs an example: for my dissertation, I had completely written-off games like Hearts as sociopolitically unimportant until some respondent mentioned that there are online lobbies where people use the game to chat about politics. I never would\u0026rsquo;ve learned that if I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to read what my respondents had taken the time to write. And there have been a few papers that make the point that we should really pay more attention to the nuance that people write in rather than (often incorrectly) discretizing them on the basis of hardline, ex ante coding rules.\nI\u0026rsquo;m envious that April and Maya had an alien superintelligence to parse through all of that data and get to all the juicy bits. Sure we have NLP and algorithims for market segmentation\u0026mdash;but do they come from a near-omniscient monkey?

URLS for the webpages for journal articles! While I’m personally pretty ambivalent towards it, that’s not something that style-guideline sticklers are gonna abide. I’d like for it to only export the URL from web sources—blogs, news articles, videos and the like—while nixing the export for others.\nSurprisingly, there isn’t an option in the Zotero App for this functionality. I came across this awesome post from vxlabs that provided the code and approach that inspired this post. Their suggestion:\n\rGo to Preferences | Advanced and click on the “Show Data Directory” button.\rEdit translators/BibTeX.js with your favourite text editor.\rIn function doExport(), at around line 2040 in Zotero 3.0.7, change the “for (var field in fieldMap)” loop by adding a single line of code like this:\r\r\rthen provided the following code:\nfor(var field in fieldMap) {\r# only add the following line:\rif (field == \u0026quot;url\u0026quot;) continue;\rif(item[fieldMap[field]]) {\rwriteField(field, item[fieldMap[field]]);\r}\r}\rfor(var field in fieldMap) {\r# only add the following line:\rif (field == \"url\") continue;\rif(item[fieldMap[field]]) {\rwriteField(field, item[fieldMap[field]]);\r}\r}\r\rThis fix makes a lot of sense! The code is just saying “hey Zotero. Just go ahead and continue past the url field when writing Bibtex entries.” It was almost perfect for my needs sans one small tick—it also nixed the urls off of webpages!\nSo in order to make it perfect (that is: in order to make it so that it skips the URLs for everything but the entries coming from webpages), you just got to add this amended text.\n for (var field in fieldMap) {\rif (field == \u0026quot;url\u0026quot; \u0026amp; item.itemType != \u0026quot;webpage\u0026quot;) continue;\rif (item[fieldMap[field]]) {\rwriteField(field, item[fieldMap[field]]);\r}\rfor (var field in fieldMap) {\rif (field == \"url\" \u0026 item.itemType != \"webpage\") continue;\rif (item[fieldMap[field]]) {\rwriteField(field, item[fieldMap[field]]);\r}\r\rThe extra bit just tells the exporter “hey! continue on along past the URL field only when the item type isn’t a webpage.” Let’s see how it works!\n","date":1592352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613361261,"objectID":"1427a6d1531e1c98b44c216ac4e745b0","permalink":"/post/how-to-remove-urls-from-zotero-bibtex/","publishdate":"2020-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-remove-urls-from-zotero-bibtex/","section":"post","summary":"I’m currently in the process of transitioning my dissertation from LibreOffice into LaTeX because I like pain it’s a lot easier to finagle all of the images and tables while making sure that I’m keeping in-line with the grad school’s style formatting requirements.","tags":["TIL","Zotero"],"title":"How to Remove URLS from Zotero Bibtex","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peter Licari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589241600,"objectID":"cb356f55f50b87356a42edc8d41e12b9","permalink":"/publication/sharp-as-fox/","publishdate":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharp-as-fox/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2012, a survey research was publicized suggesting that Fox News viewers were not only less informed than consumers of other news media but also less informed than people abstaining from news media entirely. Many have taken this to be unequivocally true and the study remains popular among political discussants to this day. However, virtually all of the investigations used to advance the argument focus on current events type knowledge and neglect important controls that could influence both political knowledge and Fox News consumption. Furthermore, no research to date has investigated any effects stemming from consuming the network’s online content (i.e., from foxnews.com). This article aims to contribute these gaps. Using the 2016 American National Election Survey (ANES), I investigate whether consuming content from foxnews.com is associated with decreased political knowledge. I find no differences in knowledge concerning how the U.S. political system works (what I call process-related knowledge) but do find a significant, negative relationship between visiting foxnews.com and facts about society writ large (what I call society-oriented knowledge). These effects persist even when controlling for party, ideology, and conservative-group affinity and in the preponderance of matching procedures employed to reduce concerns of self-selection.

(UF just let us know Yesterday that, while it isn’t yet mandatory, we should start transitioning sooner rather than later). This isn’t going to be an easy transition for a lot of us—students and faculty alike. Not everyone makes living on the Internet basically a second job. I’m planning on writing a workflow for my intended solution—hosting lectures live in a Discord server with password-protected Google Forms as attendance—in the next few days. But I know that many people are going to feel that simpler is better for them. I got this text from a good friend of mine yesterday as we were talking about it:\n\rCan I just like…screen capture my computer while I’m presenting and just upload that?\n\rAbsolutely! And it’s easy to do with some Open Source software. In fact, you can do it with whatever your presentation software of choice (PowerPoint, Google Slides, LibreOffice, Beamer, etc.). This is especially helpful because, while PowerPoint offers an easy recording option, the same can’t be said for everything. So, for this post, I’m going to walk y’all through how to use OBS to record yourself giving a PowerPoint presentation so you can upload it to your students.\nContents\r\rOBS (What it is and How to Install it)\n\rSetting up OBS\n\rManaging your export settings.\rCapturing a PowerPoint Presentation\rCapturing your Audio Voice Over\rRecording your Presentation\r\rRecording your Lecture\n\rTips for your Presentation\n\r\r\n## OBS (What it is and How to Install it)\nWhat is OBS?\rOpen Broadcaster Software (OBS) is a video recording and streaming platform released by the OBS Project. Its main software platform, OBS Studio, is incredibly popular among video game players and streamers on Twitch and YouTube. It has a number of bells and whistles that makes it really well-suited for these creators. But, most importantly for our purposes, it allows you to capture a program running on your computer, mix in audio, and export that into a file that you can easily upload to your file/video-hosting site of choice.\r\rHow to Install it\rFirst, go to the OBS Project website. Right there on the front of the screen, you should see three links that lead to downloads based off of your computer’s operating software. (You are going to need about 250 MB of free space in order to install it). Click on whichever link matches your system. Once you do that, it should begin downloading your software automatically. From there, install it as you would anything else. (Personally, I recommend just keeping everything at the default installation settings).\n\n##Setting Up OBS\nOnce you’ve installed OBS Studio, go ahead and open it like you would a normal program. (If you kept the box checked that read “Open after installation” while you were installing it, the program should do that for you automatically). You should see a screen that looks something like this:\n\nFirst thing you’re going to want to do is decide how and where you’re going to export your screen capture. For Windows 10 (my operating system), OBS defaults to using an .mkv recording format and plopping the output into your “videos” folder. That file location may or may not work for you—I’m going to tell you how to change it if doesn’t—but you’re definitely going to need to change the recording format to mp4 (which is more universally accepted on video sharing platforms than mkv).\nLook down in the lower right-hand corner and click the Settings button. A new screen should pop up. Look at the left-hand pane and click Output. Go down to the drop-down menu for Recording Format and change it from mkv to mp4. If you want to change where the video will end up on your computer, click on the Browse button that’s in-line with Recording Path. Then just navigate to the file location that you want to export the file to. I’m going to put it where I put the other media I’m using for this blogpost. You can put it wherever you want. (Or, if you’re cool with it exporting to your default videos folder, you don’t have to mess with it at all). Make sure you hit the Apply button before either clicking OK or exiting the screen. Otherwise, your settings won’t have saved.1\n\nNow let’s go ahead and get it capturing a PowerPoint presentation. Open up PowerPoint or your presentation platform of choice. I’m going to be using a LibreOffice version of my latest lecture from the Political Behavior class I’m teaching right now. It was originally made in Google Slides, so apologies if it looks a little wonky.\nNow that your presentation is open, go back to OBS. Go down to the lower left-hand panel named Sources. Click on the + icon. Start at the top and scroll down to where it says Display Capture. A new window will pop open titled something like “Create/Select Source.” Click OK. The screen should start showing a live view of your computer display. If you use multiple screens, you can go down to Display to set which one you’d like to record. If you have one screen (or, equivalently, if you set your display to be the same screen that OBS is sitting in), you’ll get a pretty trippy look into infinite recursion.2 Don’t worry. The infinite loop will not be visible during your presentation.\nClick OK to finish setting up your visual source. (You can click the eye icon in the sources panel to kill the visual feed if you don’t want to look at the recursion while you set everything else up. I’ll do that so you know how and so it won’t be a distraction.) OBS will capture anything that you have on this display. So if you want to capture a Google Slides (or Beamer presentation), simply put your browser window (pdf viewer) on that screen and OBS will capture that. This process allows you to use whatever presentation software you want. If you’re teaching programming or some kind of quantitative methods class, you can even have it display R/Stata/SPSS!3\n\nNext, we’ll set up your voice-over (that way your students aren’t just watching slides silently slipping by). You have a few options here. Most laptops (and some PCs) have built in microphones. While these aren’t the highest quality, they should do in a pinch. If you have a headset that you use to make Skype calls and the like, that can work as well. Thanks to my YouTubing, I happen to have a Blue Yeti Snowball on hand. (The Snowball is a solid entry-level podcast/vlogging microphone that’s really reasonably priced). In any event, you can go as basic or as fancy as you like. As long as you plug it in and it’s recognized by your computer, you can use it to record your audio.\nOnce you’ve plugged in your microphone (or headset) of choice, go back down to the Sources panel and click on the + again. This time, stay at the top and click the button that says Audio Input Capture. A new panel will pop open that will say something like “Create/Select Source.” Click OK. A new screen will pop up which will ask you which Device you want to use. If you are using a device (like a headset or dedicated microphone) that isn’t your computer’s default audio input channel, click the drop-down menu and select it by name.\nOnce you do that, click OK. You’ll now see a new item in the Audio Mixer pannel in the bottom-center of the screen. From here, you can mix the levels of your input channel and your desktop audio by moving the sliders. (If they’re further to the right, the audio from that source will be louder; further to the left and they’ll be softer.) My personal preference is to totally silence the audio coming from the Desktop (I don’t want the video to get random bings from Outlook and distract the viewers).\n\nNow that you’ve got everything set up, you’re ready to record. From here you’ve got a couple of options. If you’re working on just one screen, you’re going to have to minimize OBS during recording so that you avoid the infinite recursion. That’s totally fine. OBS will continue recording after you minimize the program so long as you don’t exit out of it entirely. But you will have the infinite loop for however long it takes for you to click Start Recording and minimize in the beginning and to restore the window and click Stop Recording at the end. If you think your students won’t mind—although, I’ll be candid and tell you that they probably will—you could just leave it in. If you have a video editor (like iMovie), you could just chop those bits off and re-export it. Or, my preferred option, you can set it up so that you can minimize the program, press a specific button on your keyboard, and start recording without anyone having to see all the looping.\nGo back to the lower-right part of the screen and click on the Settings button again. Go to the left-hand panel and click where it says Hotkeys (second item from the bottom). Go down to where it says Start Recording and click on the field to the right. Your mouse cursor should start blinking. Then press the button on your keyboard that you want to act as the shortcut for your recording command. I’m going to use 0 on my keyboard’s number pad, but you can use any key that you’d like. I’d just suggest not picking something that you might accidentally hit while presenting!\nOnce you’ve made your choice, click apply.\n##Recording your Presentation\nNow that you’ve got all of your settings ready to go, you’re ready to start recording your presentation! If you turned off the infinite loop, click the eye logo again to turn the visual feed back on. Then minimize (not exit) out of OBS Studio. Start up your presentation. Then, when you’re ready, press the button on your keyboard that starts your recording. (If you decided not to use the hotkeys, click Start Recording before you minimize out of OBS). Talk clearly into your microphone and make your way through the slides.\nOnce you’ve finished, press the button on your keyboard that stops your recording. Reopen OBS. DO NOT IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE PROGRAM. OBS Studio takes a while to encode your video into an mp4 format. If you close the program while it’s still in progress, you’ll just have a corrupted mess that can’t be opened let alone watched. Personally, I like to have my file viewer open to the directory that I decided to export my video to. It’ll update when the file has finished exporting.\nOnce you’ve finished the video, you have something that you can upload to your preferred elearning platform (Blackboard or Canvas) or to YouTube. I uploaded a short demo to my personal YouTube (rather than to the Professor Politics channel) where I went through the first couple minutes of the lecture so you guys can see a “final” product.\n\r\n## Tips for Your Presentation\nAs I ever-so-slyly referenced in the last paragraph, I’ve been making multimedia content for the web for a while now—pretty close to about 6-7 years. I’m not by any means an unimpeachable expert, but I’ve picked up a few things as I’ve gone along. So I wanted to pass along a few tips for when you’re recording your presentation:\n\rKeep it brief: Unless you’ve got a helluva radio voice (and an engaging personality to boot), keep your presentation shorter rather than longer. The best video educators on YouTube don’t tend to go much longer than 10-15 minutes—and they’ve usually got some kind of visual animation and music to accompany them. You won’t keep your students’ eyes on the screen for much longer than that. Even if they do, their eyes will be totally glassed over or they’ll have Facebook open in another page. (That may not sound much different than class normally for some, but trust me. It is.) I know that’s frustrating because you probably have a lot more material than that. Trim it down as best you can.\n\rIf you can’t keep it brief, do it in chunks: If you absolutely cannot cut your material down to below 10-15 minutes, make multiple, shorter videos. Find natural stopping points in your presentation and cut your videos down to about 5-7 minutes. Set up a silent alarm for about 6 minutes that’ll help you wrap it up. This technique won’t let you get away with uploading, like, 10 videos—but you can use it to upload 3-6 that’ll get far better engagement than if you just kept talking for 20-30 uninterrupted minutes.\n\rDon’t eat the mic: watch how close you’re getting to your audio input. You don’t want your lecture to get interrupted by crackles or Darth Vader-esque heavy breathing.\n\rTalk slower. Then talk slower than that: Some people (like me) are cursed with a rapid cadence. When we talk to people face-to-face, it’s easier to understand us because a lot of our meaning is translated through non-verbal means. But when it’s just you and the slides, fast talking will be the death of comprehension. Plus, if you’re not used to presenting using a microphone, you’re probably nervous about it. Even if you don’t think you’re nervous, you probably are. That’ll bleed over into how quickly you’re going through the material. So if you just finished a video and/or chunk and are thinking “wow, I sure managed to clear through those slides really quickly!”—you’re probably going to have to re-record it if you want students to know what the hell you were actually saying.\n\rAvoid being monotone: Your students probably understand that this isn’t what you signed-up for; no one’s asking for an Oscar-worthy performance. And unless you’ve got experience with acting, improv, or public speaking, it’ll probably come off as more cringy if you shoot for one. But don’t be like the teacher from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, droning on about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Try to add some variation in your voice every now and then. Change up your volume, pitch, and tone just as you would if you were speaking before a group.\n\rDon’t strive for perfection: Don’t try to make this a Ted Talk. Don’t try to make this a YouTube video. Don’t make this into a job talk or conference presentation. Don’t think that you have to have no pauses, no flubs, no imperfections. If you would say “oops, excuse me, what I meant was…” in class, you can say it here. It’s fine. 9 times out of 10, you’ll notice it far more than anyone else will.\n\rPractice before you upload: Do a couple of short practice runs (1-2 minutes) to make sure you’ve got your pacing, microphone placing, and all-around jitters sorted out before you dive in to the whole thing. As I mentioned, I’ve been doing this for years and I still have to do this. We all do. It’s better to get all the little kinks fixed before you upload your videos and you realize, to your sinking horror, there’s something that makes it utterly unwatchable.\n\r\rThis is probably going to be a stressful time for both you and your students. This transition (from offline to online) has been abrupt for and it’s having very real consequences on the day-to-day lives of everyone involved. Hopefully, this tutorial will be able to ease that transition, and diminish some of those smaller issues.\r\n\r\r\r\rDepending on how updated your graphics drivers are, you might also have to change your Encoder settings from Hardware to Software.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^) = \\begin{cases} p_0^ \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
