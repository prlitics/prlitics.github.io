&lt;script src=&#34;/post/some-thoughts-about-the-2020-election/index.en_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I thought I would post my prediction for the election and a few thoughts regarding it more generally. I‚Äôll be peppering in some maps that I‚Äôve made to help illustrate my general thought process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;when-can-we-expect-all-this-to-wrap-up&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When can we expect all this to wrap-up?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, there‚Äôs a chance that we‚Äôll know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, who the winner of the electoral college vote will be by about 9 PM. That chance goes up if we push the deadline ‚Äôtill 1 AM. But there‚Äôs also a solid chance that we won‚Äôt know for a few days to a week. Honestly, I‚Äôm not comfortable betting on which I think will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so we‚Äôre all on the same page: That doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs a snowball‚Äôs chance in Hell that we‚Äôll know the vote &lt;em&gt;totals&lt;/em&gt; by the end of the night. We never actually know the totals for all of the states by the time election night bleeds into national political hangover day. Many states (like Alaska and California) are notoriously slow with counting their ballots‚Äìand the vast majority of other states spend a few days curing problematic ballots and/or allowing ballots post-marked prior to Election day to filter in. (Military votes are in a similar situation.) We won‚Äôt see validated totals for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs how it is with &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; election. However, in normal times, we‚Äôve gotten pretty good at using a combination of exit-polls and vote totals scraped from state/county election officials‚Äô sites to &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; the eventual winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have recognized, we are not in normal times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;whats-the-hold-up.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What‚Äôs the hold-up.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word: Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of COVID-19 and general anxiety/enthusiasm catalyzed by the last four years of President Trump‚Äôs tenure, we saw mind-bogglingly high levels of early/mail-in voting. At least &lt;strong&gt;100 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; people voted early this year, according to estimates from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/1323663599697539074?s=20&#34;&gt;Michael McDonald‚Äôs US Elections Project&lt;/a&gt;. That translates to 73% of the nation‚Äôs 2016 vote total. Some states surpassed their 2016 totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all states have laws that allow them to tabulate early ballots as they come in. This map from Pew Research shows which states tabulate the votes as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/AbsenteeBallots.png&#34; style=&#34;width:50.0%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state throwing the biggest monkey-wrench into the works is undoubtedly Pennsylvania. For reasons that I‚Äôll get to in a second, Pennsylvania is critical to President Trump‚Äôs pathway to victory. Without it, he has very little chance of making it into office. Complicating things more is that Pennsylvania counts day-of votes &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; before the early vote. It could take days before the early vote totals are cleared. And given that Joe Biden appears to be leading quite dramatically among early voters, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Politics_Polls/status/1320698523030032384?s=20&#34;&gt;according to the polls&lt;/a&gt;, there is a solid chance that President Trump will appear to be leading in the state by the end of the night. If Joe Biden is winning PA by sunrise tomorrow‚Äîbarring any irregularities in the day-of counting or insanely long lines‚Äîthen he‚Äôs most likely won the election. (Even with the curse of daylight savings pushing daybreak an hour earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-see-the-election-turning-out&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How Do I See the Election Turning Out?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I see as the most likely outcome when everything is said and done. (From here on out, I‚Äôll largely be using maps I‚Äôve generated &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.270towin.com/&#34;&gt;270 to Win&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/likelyoutcome.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should caution that by ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù, I mean that I think this has somewhere between a 20-30% chance of it happening. There‚Äôs a better chance than not that I‚Äôm gonna be wrong‚Äîso don‚Äôt set your clock to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Another daylight savings joke. I‚Äôm still not over it. Now that I‚Äôm a father to a newborn, I can‚Äôt even begin to fathom how &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; parents managed this BS.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these states are seen as toss-ups: Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. I settled on the answers that I did largely by taking these states, case-by-case, and thinking about how they performed over the last few elections, including 2018 and 2016, and their current political momentum. Here‚Äôs an abbreviated look at my rationale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arizona:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term trend towards purple, favoring Red; generally unfavorable to Trump and Trumpism in particular; 2018 strong showing for Democrats + strong polling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florida:&lt;/strong&gt; Purple for a long time; recent history of Blue on Presidential races; super tight midterm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia:&lt;/strong&gt; Solid red in Presidential contests; maintained Red in midterms; getting closer but still a red state in the south.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iowa:&lt;/strong&gt; Swingy the last couple decades, but a consistent polling lead for Trump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maine-2:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally weak right as is; fairly large disdain for Trumpism; consistent Biden Lead (albeit small).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nebraska-2:&lt;/strong&gt; Consistent polling lead for Biden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Carolina:&lt;/strong&gt; Swingy; solid 2018 performance; consistent advantage for Biden in Polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ohio:&lt;/strong&gt; The supposed king-maker. Consistent Trump advantage in the polling; solid Republican performance in 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texas:&lt;/strong&gt; Gradual demographic transition to purple accelerated by Trump. It‚Äôd be bat-üí© crazy if it went from stalwart Red to true purple within a single cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;which-states-im-most-likely-to-be-wrong-about.&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which states I‚Äôm most likely to be wrong about.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states I‚Äôm most likely to get wrong are probably Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Maine-2. I think Maine-2 will be a decent indicator of how well the GOP‚Äôs senate chances will fair though; if that goes Blue, Collins is probably toast and any hopes that incumbents will be insulated from down-ballot effects stemming from Trump most likely go out the window. I‚Äôm less bullish on the senate flipping than others, but that will be a fair indicator of a bad night for the GOP all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;biden-pathways-to-victory&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden Pathways to victory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;biden-has-a-strong-wall&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biden has a strong wall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I‚Äôm as bullish as I am for Biden (besides the appeal of the alliteration) is that the current toss-ups can literally &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; break for President Trump and Biden would &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; win‚Äîprovided there aren‚Äôt any major surprises in the polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/trumpwinsall.PNG&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of these states are equal with regards to the President‚Äôs chances. No state‚Äôs return is independent of the others‚Äîif Biden won Texas, that means we‚Äôre looking at a &lt;em&gt;bona fide&lt;/em&gt; blue malestrom, let alone a wave‚Äîbut some states give more information about how other states are going to break than others. &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight has a tool&lt;/a&gt; that uses the correlations among polling errors to show how a victory in some states ripples out to signal what‚Äôs happening in others. A Trump win in Georgia doesn‚Äôt shift things much, nor does one in Texas, because frankly it‚Äôs a shock that they‚Äôre even in play. A win in Florida, however, drastically lowers Biden‚Äôs chances and suggests a map that looks like the one above. However, even in that case, the President is still &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; favored to win if only for the fact that Biden is still leading in the Electoral college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-upshot-however-is-that-if-trump-loses-any-of-those-states-his-only-path-to-victory-lies-in-there-being-large-unprecedented-degrees-of-polling-error.&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The upshot however is that if Trump &lt;em&gt;loses&lt;/em&gt; any of those states, his only path to victory lies in there being large, unprecedented degrees of polling error.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. Some of you might be thinking: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúBut Peter! The polls in 2016‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; to which I will reply (for what I pray to all that is good and holy is the &lt;strong&gt;last time&lt;/strong&gt;) that even the state level polls did &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-are-all-right/&#34;&gt;reasonably well in 2016&lt;/a&gt; in the aggregate‚Äîand more pollsters have been doing more &lt;em&gt;high quality&lt;/em&gt; state-level polls than last time. There have also been adjustments across the industry to account for the biggest systematic source of polling error in 2016, which was not properly accounting for Trump‚Äôs support among White, non-college educated voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bidens-best-cases&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biden‚Äôs best case(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best case scenario for Biden is that he picks-up all of the toss-ups. But I should really emphasize that &lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt think this is a particularly likely outcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/bidenlandslide.PNG&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more realistic ‚Äúgreat day‚Äù scenario for Biden is that he wins picks up Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia while Trump gets Texas, Ohio, and Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/bidenmorelikely.PNG&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging from the correlations in polling errors, Florida will be a good (but not perfect) indicator of how Georgia and North Carolina go. (Georgia could be called first but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that Florida will go with it; the leverage one state has over another is asymmetric. For example: North Carolina going red/blue means less for Texas‚Äô eventual outcome than Texas going red/blue means for North Carolina.) Ohio will probably provide a good (but, again, &lt;em&gt;not perfect&lt;/em&gt;) indication for how the other three states will break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;trump-pathways-to-victory&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trump Pathways to victory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;without-pennsylvania&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Without Pennsylvania&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I expect the President to lose doesn‚Äôt mean I think his loss is &lt;em&gt;inevitable.&lt;/em&gt; But it‚Äôs tough. Really tough. And it‚Äôs made all the tougher because he‚Äôs currently not favored in Pennsylvania. And by ‚Äúnot favored in Pennsylvania‚Äù I mean that &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/pennsylvania&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; is giving Biden a 95% chance of carrying the state&lt;/a&gt;. Trump will have to outperform the polls by a strong margin to carry the day. The most likely states, given the margin of error for the most recent state level polls, is Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine-2 and Nebraska-2. That will give Trump 270 votes in the Electoral College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/trumpnopa.PNG&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to stress how unlikely that is. Many of these wins are not all that correlated with each other‚Äîmeaning that a win in any of them early on doesn‚Äôt necessarily portend a Biden defeat. (Other state combinations are also possible, but we‚Äôd be talking about even &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely polling errors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;with-pennsylvania&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With Pennsylvania&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trump victory in Pennsylvania &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; improves the President‚Äôs chances. If the President wins there, it‚Äôs likely that he‚Äôs winning in a lot of other places that he‚Äôs currently not favored. However,it should be noted that &lt;em&gt;even then&lt;/em&gt; he‚Äôd still need to pick up every one of the toss-up states. That can be helped by the fact that winning Pennsylvania would suggest a large degree of errors in the polls. But that degree of error is, I have to emphasize, really improbable. This outcome isn‚Äôt necessarily &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely than the one above, but pulling-off Pennsylvania would be an incredible upset. And, honestly, I would probably need to seriously reevaluate my life choices should it happen: especially my chosen profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/trumpwithpa.PNG&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point to consider when weighing out the importance of Pennsylvania is just how &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; that would make the contest. Basically, if Trump wins every toss-up state, then we‚Äôre not going to know the election‚Äôs outcome until about the end of the week &lt;em&gt;at earliest.&lt;/em&gt; Because, as mentioned above, &lt;em&gt;Pennsylvania counts their early votes last and haven‚Äôt started counting them at all.&lt;/em&gt; If Trump is ahead by the end of the night, we‚Äôll just have to wait and see if the Biden advantage banked-up from early voting is enough. (Although, as a Floridian, I must confess that it‚Äôll be nice to have all of the attention away from us for once.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;in-short-in-order-for-the-president-to-win-hes-going-to-have-to-pull-off-one-helluva-upset.-that-doesnt-make-it-impossible-upsets-happen-all-the-time-but-by-definition-it-makes-it-unlikely.&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In short, in order for the President to win, he‚Äôs going to have to pull-off one helluva upset. That doesn‚Äôt make it impossible (upsets happen all the time) but, by definition, it makes it &lt;em&gt;unlikely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;cool.-but-what-if-trump-doesnt-leave&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cool. But what if Trump doesn‚Äôt leave?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand the concern some have that Trump won‚Äôt leave given that, for the first time in American history, a President has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power. If he refuses to concede the election, we‚Äôll be in an unprecedented situation in our country. (And, yes, I‚Äôm including &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1876_United_States_presidential_election&#34;&gt;1876&lt;/a&gt; because there wasn‚Äôt an incumbent involved with that colossal cluster f*ck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being unprecedented here at home doesn‚Äôt mean unprecedented abroad. The last few decades are unfortunately replete with examples of democratic states backsliding into either competitive or outright authoritarianism. And there are lessons to be learned there. Namely, a Trump coup is unlikely to be fruitful if he doesn‚Äôt have the support of key power brokers in the Government as well as in the Military. And I frankly don‚Äôt think Trump has that support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Congressional Republicans, while they certainly have acquiesced to large expanses in executive power‚Äîand excused a number of insane controversies‚Äîthey have, to their credit, largely rebuked the President when he made suggestions that are unequivocally undemocratic (such as moving election day or not peacefully conceding an electoral loss.) McConnell‚Äôs support of the President seems to extend only as far as the latter been able to reliably install conservative judges into the federal judiciary. I‚Äôm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; saying that we should sleep on the possibility that McConnell and the rest turn out to be entirely without scruples and little-d democratic principles. But I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; saying that we shouldn‚Äôt necessarily buy-in to the idea that they‚Äôll do such open, incontrovertibly authoritarian moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Trump would need the support of the Military. Looking at how they responded to his attempts to deploy troops during the height of the protests earlier this year, I feel more confident saying that he doesn‚Äôt have it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/more-200-retired-generals-admirals-endorse-biden-including-some-who-n1240842&#34;&gt;Additionally, 200 retired generals, including a few who served under Trump, endorsed Biden.&lt;/a&gt; I‚Äôm not saying that this means the entire current membership of the higher brass does, too‚Äîbut Trump‚Äôs support would need to be far more consolidated than it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs quite likely that Trump will be a petulant child up until Joe Biden is sworn in. It would be, without a doubt, the most bonkers lame-duck period in modern American history. But I think that, if he loses the election, there‚Äôs a far better chance that he leaves than him fighting to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A more likely issue was/is Trump stealing the election. However, a number of important lower and Supreme Court decisions over the last few weeks‚Äîeven those posed to conservative justices‚Äîhave largely come back against the GOP plaintiffs. The President has been open about his hopes that the election will be close so that they can be litigated in the courts. But there seems to be a better chance that it‚Äôs not close enough for them to entertain all of the challenges he and his team have cooked up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;so-does-a-biden-win-mean-that-american-democracy-is-safe&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So does a Biden win mean that American democracy is safe?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahahhahahahahhahahhahhahhaha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you serious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah * laughs start breaking down into sobs *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think American democracy is in peril. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily a controversial position among those who study democratic regimes and how they degrade. But I don‚Äôt think that Joe Biden is going to single-handidly (or even jointly, with Kamala Harris and/or a unified Democratic government) save the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll probably write (or record) more about this later so I won‚Äôt give it all away now: But we‚Äôre going to need to see governmental reforms the likes of which we haven‚Äôt seen since the post-Watergate Congress. We‚Äôre going to need that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a major overhaul in our media environment &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strengthening of our critical institutions &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a lot of elite coordination and cooperation across both sides of the political spectrum &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a public shift in what conduct we do and don‚Äôt condone, see as civil and uncivil, as acceptable and unacceptable. None of it has to be resolved day one, or even within Biden‚Äôs tenure, but we need to make serious progress in these areas. There is no other option. Because our political momentum, in this current moment, does not bode well; our trajectory follows a well-worn path into authoritarianism and there are dispiriting few junctures remaining to veer off of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible. I am ever the optimist‚Äîif only for my own sanity. But the work has only just begun. And it must be done even if I‚Äôm wrong and Biden loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I‚Äôm being honest, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by all of the chaos and craziness that was mail-in and drop-off voting in the 2020 election, my students from my 2020 Election Data Science class and I created an app designed to help people find ballot-drop-off and early voting locations. The app received thousands of hits, helped at least a few people safely find ballot drop-off locations, and is now archived on my GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
