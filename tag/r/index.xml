      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by all of the chaos and craziness that was mail-in and drop-off voting in the 2020 election, my students from my 2020 Election Data Science class and I created an app designed to help people find ballot-drop-off and early voting locations. The app received thousands of hits, helped at least a few people safely find ballot drop-off locations, and is now archived on my GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dumdum&lt;/code&gt; is an R package that makes making dummy variables easier. There are functions that do this sort of work in packages like &lt;code&gt;caret&lt;/code&gt;, but I wanted to make a set of functions that would help other social scientists and/or analysts who were not as deep down the machine-learning rabbit hole. Click above to the GitHub site for how to download it and use it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
