      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by all of the chaos and craziness that was mail-in and drop-off voting in the 2020 election, my students from my 2020 Election Data Science class and I created an app designed to help people find ballot-drop-off and early voting locations. The app received thousands of hits, helped at least a few people safely find ballot drop-off locations, and is now archived on my GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
