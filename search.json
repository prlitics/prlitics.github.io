    "text": "Who am I?\nI’m a behavioral data scientist, writer, and content creator. I’m currently a Director of Commercial Data Science at Morning Consult, where I lead the data science work for our Advocacy and Government region. I earned my PhD in Political Science from the University of Florida in the fall of 2020. I specialized in American Political Behavior and Research Methodology. I wrote my dissertation on the ways that video games can affect political attitudes and participation. It’s freely available online if the topic strikes you as interesting.\nApart from that, I am a husband to my incredible wife, Stephanie, a father to my boisterous daughter, Rosalina, fur father to a greyhound (Dude) and bombay (Asia), and a Quaker. (There. Now you can say that you know one who isn’t on the oatmeal box).\n\n\nWhat do I do?\nMuch of my work can categorized into four (often overlapping domains): Empirical, Methodological, Exploratory, and Ludic:\n\nMy empirical work focuses on political behavior. I am interested in the stuff that goes on in the space between our ears, how it is shaped by psychological, sociological, institutional, technological, and historical factors—and how it all comes to be expressed as attitudes and actions.\nMy methodological work is largely informed by the questions posed at my day job. (Some may call this relationship endogenous—and they’d be right). Accordingly, most of it centers around applied statistics and survey research: causal inference, survey experiments, multilevel regression modeling, scale construction and validation, etc. Though most of my work is quantitative, my favorite stuff to consume and produce also incorporates qualitative and theoretical components. I’m deeply interested in the epistemological assumptions and implications undergirding our research practices as well as with the philosophical study of knowlege-generating practices more broadly.\nMy exploratory work tends to focus on sharing the science and history behind our endlessly fascinating social world. I love using my writing, YouTube channel, and data visualizations to tease apart—and find the common threads within—current events, academic research, pop-culture, and everyday observations.\nMy ludic work tends to boil down to puzzle-solving and tinkering. Luidic derives from the latin word for play (ludus), which pretty well describes what I do when I engage with it. Sometimes I stumble upon a question, idea, or challenge and I play around with models and solutions. I enjoy thinking about the interactions of actors, rules, incentives, and systems; I like to play within (and with) the constraints of everyday things to gain a deeper understanding of them—and sometimes create something new. I consider a lot of my programming, automation, and artistic outputs to fall under this category.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I can be found spending time with my wonderful family, reading, cooking, playing video games, training for my next road race, or overthinking popular media while binging it. (Often doing many of these things at the same time).\n\n\nWhy “Data and Other Fables”?\nGreat question! Fables are short, fantastical little yarns that speak to something true outside their context. The best data, given the right voice, are the same.\nThe title was inspired by two books and a quote: Economic Fables by Ariel Rubinstein, Regression and Other Stories by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari and “All models are wrong, but some are useful” a la George Box. (Though if I had to trace the through-line further, I would say that it also owes some debt to the quip”artists use lies to tell the truth” from the film V for Vendetta ). The thread yoking them together is the idea that quantitative and theoretical models are fundamentally false in the same way that stories or other forms of narrative art are. At best, they are simplifications of reality. They have to be, lest they wind up being like Lewis Caroll’s map that’s a 1:1 replica of the terrain. That’s not to say that they contain zero truth—quite many powerful truths have been conveyed through fiction. Just that whatever true things are conveyed are only approximate articulations of the whole—and that these approximations come bundled up in emphases, omissions, explicit interpretations, tacit associations, and leaps of logic and faith. That is, comprised of all the stuff of human voice when it sets itself upon the task of storytelling.\nPlus, the title conveys the fact that I won’t just be talking data on this blog. If you couldn’t guess, I’ve got other interests outside of that. I like books, science, comics, heavy metal, philosophy, video games, poetry, art, and garbage anime. I figure that this can be just as much a home for reflections on that stuff as it is tutorials and sErIoUs CoMmEnTaRy."

    "text": "The dissertation uses a mix of survey data, archival work, content analysis, and randomized controlled experimentation to present 4 main arguments:\n\nJust like any other narrative medium, games tell stories to their consumers; stories that often concern or contain things that are relevant to our society at large. These stories are known to engender effects to our political behaviors when presented in the format of the news, movies, television shows, and novels. In this respect games are no different.\nUnlike those other forms of media, though, games are far more interactive. The player is acting upon their experiences in ways that they can’t with other media. They are active agents in these worlds. The socially, morally, and politically relevant content is often contingent or can otherwise be linked to the actions that players perform via their avatars. And the behaviors they practice and perform behind the screen can have ramifications beyond it.\nBut the effects of games are not limited to their content: video games have always been social experiences. They encouraging new relationships and strengthen those that already exist. We know that, generally, these behaviors lead to increased political action—and this dissertation argues that the networks established around games are no different. They also lead to increased activity through the creation and maintenance of social capital as well as increasing the opportunities people have to be exposed to political talk.\nThese effects are not haphazard. Game designers consciously put relevant content into their games and strive for their multiplayer experiences to create feelings of community. And they (treatments sociopolitical issues and multiplayer opportunities) can be readily found in the vast majority of the most popular games released from 2007–2017. And these effects are not rare or uncommon. Gaming is not just for the young, awkward, and/or antisocial. Nearly 2 out every 5 Americans play games that engage with sociopolitical issues—and more play games socially with friends.\n\nGames, in short, matter—in a lot of ways and for a lot of people. This dissertation provides one of Political Science’s first look into how and why.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"

(UF just let us know Yesterday that, while it isn’t yet mandatory, we should start transitioning sooner rather than later). This isn’t going to be an easy transition for a lot of us—students and faculty alike. Not everyone makes living on the Internet basically a second job. I’m planning on writing a workflow for my intended solution—hosting lectures live in a Discord server with password-protected Google Forms as attendance—in the next few days. But I know that many people are going to feel that simpler is better for them. I got this text from a good friend of mine yesterday as we were talking about it:\nAbsolutely! And it’s easy to do with some Open Source software. In fact, you can do it with whatever your presentation software of choice (PowerPoint, Google Slides, LibreOffice, Beamer, etc.). This is especially helpful because, while PowerPoint offers an easy recording option, the same can’t be said for everything. So, for this post, I’m going to walk y’all through how to use OBS to record yourself giving a PowerPoint presentation so you can upload it to your students."

    "section": " Tips for Your Presentation",
    "text": "Tips for Your Presentation\nAs I ever-so-slyly referenced in the last paragraph, I’ve been making multimedia content for the web for a while now—pretty close to about 6-7 years. I’m not by any means an unimpeachable expert, but I’ve picked up a few things as I’ve gone along. So I wanted to pass along a few tips for when you’re recording your presentation:\n\nKeep it brief: Unless you’ve got a helluva radio voice (and an engaging personality to boot), keep your presentation shorter rather than longer. The best video educators on YouTube don’t tend to go much longer than 10-15 minutes—and they’ve usually got some kind of visual animation and music to accompany them. You won’t keep your students’ eyes on the screen for much longer than that. Even if they do, their eyes will be totally glassed over or they’ll have Facebook open in another page. (That may not sound much different than class normally for some, but trust me. It is.) I know that’s frustrating because you probably have a lot more material than that. Trim it down as best you can.\nIf you can’t keep it brief, do it in chunks: If you absolutely cannot cut your material down to below 10-15 minutes, make multiple, shorter videos. Find natural stopping points in your presentation and cut your videos down to about 5-7 minutes. Set up a silent alarm for about 6 minutes that’ll help you wrap it up. This technique won’t let you get away with uploading, like, 10 videos—but you can use it to upload 3-6 that’ll get far better engagement than if you just kept talking for 20-30 uninterrupted minutes.\nDon’t eat the mic: watch how close you’re getting to your audio input. You don’t want your lecture to get interrupted by crackles or Darth Vader-esque heavy breathing.\nTalk slower. Then talk slower than that: Some people (like me) are cursed with a rapid cadence. When we talk to people face-to-face, it’s easier to understand us because a lot of our meaning is translated through non-verbal means. But when it’s just you and the slides, fast talking will be the death of comprehension. Plus, if you’re not used to presenting using a microphone, you’re probably nervous about it. Even if you don’t think you’re nervous, you probably are. That’ll bleed over into how quickly you’re going through the material. So if you just finished a video and/or chunk and are thinking “wow, I sure managed to clear through those slides really quickly!”—you’re probably going to have to re-record it if you want students to know what the hell you were actually saying.\nAvoid being monotone: Your students probably understand that this isn’t what you signed-up for; no one’s asking for an Oscar-worthy performance. And unless you’ve got experience with acting, improv, or public speaking, it’ll probably come off as more cringy if you shoot for one. But don’t be like the teacher from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, droning on about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Try to add some variation in your voice every now and then. Change up your volume, pitch, and tone just as you would if you were speaking before a group.\nDon’t strive for perfection: Don’t try to make this a Ted Talk. Don’t try to make this a YouTube video. Don’t make this into a job talk or conference presentation. Don’t think that you have to have no pauses, no flubs, no imperfections. If you would say “oops, excuse me, what I meant was…” in class, you can say it here. It’s fine. 9 times out of 10, you’ll notice it far more than anyone else will.\nPractice before you upload: Do a couple of short practice runs (1-2 minutes) to make sure you’ve got your pacing, microphone placing, and all-around jitters sorted out before you dive in to the whole thing. As I mentioned, I’ve been doing this for years and I still have to do this. We all do. It’s better to get all the little kinks fixed before you upload your videos and you realize, to your sinking horror, there’s something that makes it utterly unwatchable.\n\nThis is probably going to be a stressful time for both you and your students. This transition (from offline to online) has been abrupt for and it’s having very real consequences on the day-to-day lives of everyone involved. Hopefully, this tutorial will be able to ease that transition, and diminish some of those smaller issues."

    "title": "How to Do Unequal Randomization in Qualtrics Surveys",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, some coauthors and I were working on a survey experiment in Qualtrics where we were assigning people into 4 different groups. This is something that Qualtrics can do really easily with its in-built randomizer function. If you use this, and keep evenly present elements on, your respondents will be sorted in roughly evenly. So if you have 16 respondents and 4 groups, on average you’ll get 4 people per group.\nBut we had a different situation. We had four groups but we didn’t want it split evenly. We wanted it so that group 1 was half of the survey, and groups 2, 3, and 4 took up thirds of the remaining half.\nUnfortunately, Qualtrics doesn’t seem to have an option that let’s you select unequal probabilities natively. If you deselect “evenly present elements” it’ll just randomize without any real concern towards whether your groups end up looking roughly equal. But that’s not what we needed. So I wanted to write about our solution to this so, hopefully, others in a similar situation might be able to find a work-around that works for them, too!\nOur solution used embedded data, then branches, and the standard randomizer. I’ll also talk about how you might be able to generalize this to any number of conditions (although some are more work than others)."

    "text": "Starting with Embedded Data\nAs you probably know: After you’re done with your Qualtrics survey, you can export it as a csv or as a xlsx file. In addition to the answers to your questions, it’ll also include some project and respondent metadata. But you can also program the survey for it to include you’re own custom metadata to be embedded in the project. You can do this by clicking on the “add new element here” button and adding embedded data to the project.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you can customize your field to have whatever name you want. You can also set the value for this field. Here I set a variable named “test” equal to the value “1”. When I export the results for this survey, there will be a new column called “test” where the value for every respondent will be 1.\n Importantly, though, you can also set multiple conditions for the embedded data field! You do this by clicking “add below” and adding more embedded data sections.\n\nPop quiz! What would you get in the “test” column if you ran this survey as is?\nYou’d get 4 because, right now, you’re telling Qualtrics:\n\nInvent a column called test. Set it equal to 1.\nActually, remember test? Set it to 2.\nI lied. Make it 3 now.\nJk. 4.\n\nHere’s where we start using the randomizer."

    "text": "“OMG so random…”\nAs it stands now, you’re going to end up with a field called test where the value is set to 3 for all respondents. Instead of that, we can use the randomizer to make it so that 1/4 of the sample has a value of 1 for test, 1/4 has a value of 2, 1/4 has a value of 3, and 1/4 has a value of 4.\n You may be thinking “Cool. But this doesn’t do anything for me. I’m right back at equal probabilities for my experimental conditions.” And you’d be right if we were stopping here.\nBut we’re not stopping here.\n\nWe’re going to nest randomization conditions.\n\nThis programming is pretty similar to what we ended up using. Let’s follow the logic of the flow:\n\nRandomly pick either the test 1 condition with 50 % probability.\nIf it is not picked, then randomly select one of the remaining 3 conditions with 1/3 probability each.\n\nThis will mean that half of the respondents will get test1 and 1/6th will go to each test2, test3, and test4. Which is what the situation is in the second image and exactly what we were looking for in the real-life scenario.\nThis nesting is the key thing here. By nesting your randomizers strategically, there are few combinations that you won’t be able to achieve. This sort of set up can be really useful if you’re doing a multifactorial survey experiment.\nWe can wrap this all up with a neat bow through some branching."

    "text": "Branch it out\nNow we can do some branches so that our participants only see the blocks that they’re intended to see. Then branches work off of boolean logic. If a condition is TRUE then it’ll run a particular course of action. If it’s FALSE then it won’t run that action. In Qualtrics, you can set the branching logic so that it reflects the metadata that was assigned to participants through the randomizer.\n After that, you can add the block that you wanted people with test condition 1 (and only test condition 1) to see. And if you repeat it out, then you can complete the whole survey flow. Here’s basically what our survey looked like once the logic is completed all the way to the end.\n\nOne of the things I really like about this approach (rather than, say, using a random number generator and a bunch of then branches) is that this makes your later analysis pretty easy. If you’re making pivot tables, you can group off of that variable’s value. If you’re doing ANOVA in SPSS, Stata, or R, you’ve got a single variable already to go without having to do any post-hoc coding. It also makes it easier to set dummy variables if you do a more advanced regression analysis. I’m personally a big fan of doing small-to-moderate amounts of work up-front to save myself larger amounts of work down the road. I’m a big believer that work borrowed from your future self compounds with interest."

    "text": "But aside from just being human, well-written, and the right mix of cynical and optimistic, it is also just an eminently and endlessly quotable book. There are quotes here that I plan on using when I talk about machine learning in my upcoming data science class. Quotes that just stabbed me in the chest with self-recognition (cough cough Miranda being a workaholic cough cough). And then there are quotes that make me feel that Green is one of the few science fiction authors who actually understand the sociology and psychology of being a practicing scientist (which, ya know, SciShow and his M.S.—so it makes sense). But then there’s this quote near the end of the book that so perfectly described being a survey researcher that it made me laugh out loud:\n\n[We wanted to] dive deep into our survey responses. Except there were just too many…no matter how we filtered, there just wasn’t a good way.\nApril and I were griping about this around the black marble countertop in the kitchen when Carl came in and overheard us.\n“Just do a search,” Carl said.\n“The searches take forever and we don’t know what to search for,” April replied. “It’s just a bunch of dumb data. Most of the useful stuff is in text responses, which is impossible to parse.”\n\nI loved and loathed the reductionism of “dumb data”—mostly because it’s right. Until we data geeks make the decisions on what to model, how to model it, and how to frame and embed our results into a digestable narrative, it is literally just that. Dumb data, (sometimes) intelligently collected. And also, it’s so, so spot-on to note that almost all of the really juicy stuff is in the open-ended responses where people just let you know what’s actually going on. Or at least their inwardly-biased interpretation of their messy cognitive processes—which is still super cool and really interesting!\nAs an example: for my dissertation, I had completely written-off games like Hearts as sociopolitically unimportant until some respondent mentioned that there are online lobbies where people use the game to chat about politics. I never would’ve learned that if I didn’t bother to read what my respondents had taken the time to write. And there have been a few papers that make the point that we should really pay more attention to the nuance that people write in rather than (often incorrectly) discretizing them on the basis of hardline, ex ante coding rules.\nI’m envious that April and Maya had an alien superintelligence to parse through all of that data and get to all the juicy bits. Sure we have NLP and algorithims for market segmentation—but do they come from a near-omniscient monkey? Didn’t think so.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{licari2020,\n  author = {Peter Licari and Peter Licari},\n  title = {Surveying Is a {Beautifully} {Foolish} {Endeavor}},\n  date = {2020-08-03},\n  url = {www.peterlicari.com/posts/surveying-beautiful-endeavor},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPeter Licari, and Peter Licari. 2020. “Surveying Is a Beautifully\nFoolish Endeavor.” August 3, 2020. www.peterlicari.com/posts/surveying-beautiful-endeavor."

    "text": "When I went to graduate school, my very first class was called “Scope and Epistemology”—or “Scope” for short. It was a rite of passage for all who entered UF’s political science PhD progam. Taught by the brilliant (and brilliantly kind) Larry Dodd, the course syllabus was often mistaken as one of its textbooks. The damn thing was 30 pages and outlined thousands of pages of books and articles, from Kuhn to Gleick to Mayr, Gattone, and even freaking Asimov, that meant to show us not only the diversity of practices in social science but the equally remarkable diversity of beliefs over just what the heck this thing called “science” actually is. It was a whirlwind tour of epistemology, philosophy, and sociology of science. (Predominantly social science given, ya know, it was a poli sci PhD program—but not exclusively so, much to the course’s benefit). I was not unfamiliar with either philosophy or epistemology (I was a hair’s breath away from double-majoring in philosophy in undergrad), but it was an intimidating program. We were quickly reassured by more advanced students that, no, we didn’t have to “read” all of it—at least not in the sense one would read things in undergrad (a time-honored advisory that I would oft repeat many times myself to newer students, furthering the tradition). I still own many of those books and refer back to a few when I feel the need. The course cemented my latent loves of philosophy, epistemology, and science into (what I’m sure to be) a lifelong fascination: one focused with not only practicing social science but also interrogating “what even is this thing we call (social) science?” in philosophical terms.\nMany of us came to realize that the syllabus for Scope was less a contract of expectations and more a gift. That “whirlwind tour” was a synthesis of decades of epistemological tumult that Dodd had lived through first hand. And since the issues were far from settled, I feel like he was also giving us a preview into many of the ideas and controversies we would have to grapple with ourselves over the course of our scientific careers.\nThis love is what drove me to pick up Theory and Reality by Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) from Amazon’s Audible service. 1Theory and Reality is an ambitious book that aims to accessibly cover a large swath of historical and philosophical ground. In many ways, it lives up to that ambition. In other, important ways though, the book at times does feel like it devolves into, to use Godfrey-Smith’s own verbiage, a muddy paste. There were times where I would relisten to chapters (sometimes three times) just to make sure I fully understood what was covered. I feel like the book rewards this effort, but not everyone will want to exert it. Still, what it does well, it does very well—making this book well worth the read.\n\nAt the outset, Godfrey-Smith expresses that his overarching aim in writing this book is to convey a history of the philosophy of science; specifically a history in two senses of the word. The first is a timelie of the predominating ideas of the discipline (as well as from adjacent fields such as sociology of science): How have we conceptualized this thing we call “science,” as well the actions (both idealized and actual) of its practitioners? The second is a narrative of how said ideas (and their progenitors) interacted with each other.\nThis is more or less what he manages to do in the first third of the book. The first two substantive chapters start with brief discussion of early 20th century empiricism and its major philosophical tenets and issues (e.g., the issues of induction and confirmation), shift into a chapter on Popper, two on Kuhn (or, rather, two primarily on The Structure of Scientific Revolutions), a chapter on Lakatosh, Laudon, and Feyerabend (not apiece—collectively), a short chapter blitzing through the sociology of science in the middle third of the century, then a chapter on feminist contributions to the subject, before pivoting to naturalistic philosophy. He doesn’t do so as a impassive retrospective observer though; he frequently interjects the discussions with both critiques and endorsements to the material. This includes both those that are generally accepted in the field as well as some of his own—though his is admirably careful and forthright in which views fall into which category. He does have a tendency to be a bit dismissive of some ideas without motivating clear reasons why (and these instances are highlighted due to the equally discernible tendency for other objections to get more strenuous refutations), but his contributions, on balance, add rather than detract from the quality of the section.\nThe core argument of this first section can be crystalized as follows: The early-to-middle(late) century for philosophy of science was characterized by a schism between empiricists (e.g., positivits) and those . Both sides had incredibly novel and important insights, but both often proffered leads that turned out to be dead-ends—or overplayed their philosophical hands, cornering themselves into very strange positions (Popper’s articulation of corroboration and some sociologists’ assertion that the world is in fact created at a foundational level by the theories and paradigms of scientists2).\nIt’d be a lot of ground to cover even without the additional commentary. But Godfrey-Smith manages to do so at a high average quality, albeit with noticeable variation. Perhaps it owes to my experience in Scope and in my undergraduate coursework prior to grad school, but I found it pretty easy to follow-along with the first few chapters—and I found the most of the interjections to be illuminating. (I especially liked his approach to the Black-Raven, White-Shoe issue in accounting inductive evidence—especially the version detailed late in the book when he discusses evidence). He was at his best when he dedicated his time to discussing narrower philosophical issues or the contributions of individual philosophers. The chapters on evidence, Popper, Kuhn, and the ensuing Lakatosh-Laudon-Feyerabend lightening round were some of the best in the book. Where things got less good (though not necessarily “bad”, for my view) is when he tried to cover entire fields in singular chapters. The Sociology of Science and Feminism chapters were among those aforementioned thrice-listens. I initially thought that it was because I was unfamiliar with the material, then I thought it was because I just wasn’t grokking it; but on the final time I realized that he was simply moving way too fucking fast. I sympathize with the challenge of distilling such large amounts of work into such a a condensed space—but considering he made two chapters out of Kuhn alone, it seems like a self-inflected wound with an obvious remedy: Split it out into a couple more chapters.\nIf history was Godfrey-Smith’s sole aim, the book could have been cut here. But that ultimately isn’t his full intention. The second aim of the book is to discuss the contemporary paradigms (or perhaps I should say “research traditions”) that dominated philosophy of science at the writing of his book—and they largely continue to hold sway today. The final aim is his advancing his own solutions to the core problems he identifies in the second part—though they all have roots in the discussions predominating the first. Throughout the book, he refers to these aims as “thirds” of the book—but, in reality, it’s more like history takes up the first 45% of the book before pivoting to\nThe chapter discussing naturalism more or less coincides with the transition into this pivot. Naturalism’s uptake comes nearer the end of the 20th century; but so do the other new agendas and perspectives that he focuses on. So he more or less abandons the chronological approach he took with the first section (though this doesn’t come as a surprise; he announces it as it happens). The chapters to come tackle “naturalistic” philosophies broadly, first on its own terms and then with regards to the “social structure of science;” It then pivots to “scientific realism”, a chapter on “explanation”, one on Bayesianism and evidence, and then one trying to harmonize the differences between empiricism, naturalism, and scientific realism. In this chapter, he retells the story of a reviewer warning that this final chapter has the potential to devolve into a “muddy paste.” As you might be able to guess from my use of the phrase earlier, it’s a critique that I largely agree with.\nBut the thing about paste, muddy or otherwise, is that it’s still pretty sticky. So while the concepts tended to blur together here3, the chapters does a pretty good job at having you stick around. This was some of the most engrossing material in the book, and I found my head moving quite vigorously at different parts of the book. It was mostly vertical when talking about how the aim of science is to use different “representational vehicles” (some linguistic, some mathematical, some visual, some computationally simulated, etc.) to provide an accurate representation of phenomena and relations observed in the real world—and when defending the broader tendency of science to invoke heretofore unobservable structures as part of a broader aim to explain what happens in the world. It did shake in the other direction when discussing Bayesianism because, at times, the approach appeared too glib and dismissive (such as the odd treatment of “Dutch books” and the thin objection to it on the grounds that some people may be averse to gambling)4. And I definitely found myself agreeing with the general conclusion to the book: That science is both an individual exercise and a social one. That scientists do aim to model the real world and that it is possible (and indeed advisable) to conditionally accept inductive arguments that have survived repeated testing with risky procedures. But also that scientists are engaged in a foundationally social enterprise and that we can only best understand their work (and the philosophy of science as well) as being influenced (and at times, constrained) by these social forces.\n\nAll in all, I think Theory and Reality accomplishes what it sets out to do, though with varying degrees of clarity and persuasiveness. What it does well, it does very well—and there are moments where it manages to do exactly that throughout the whole book. But those moments are more heavily concentrated in the first half and in the concluding segments of a few of the final chapters; these successes, and their asymmetric spread, also serves to more severely accentuate the places where it doesn’t do as well. Places where the positions either expressed or taken weren’t as clear. Places where it felt too rushed to do such a large chapter-topic justice.\nBut I believe that this book is well deserving of a read by those interested in the philosophy of science broadly. It is a good survey of many ideas in the field, it incorporates and takes seriously competing intellectual programs that don’t often get coverage in other locations (i.e., feminist epistemology and critiques of science), and offers persuasive accounts for what scientists do, how, and why. Indeed, when I finished the book my first main feeling was sadness. Not because it was bad (because it was quite good), not because it was over (because it’s hard for any philosophy book to be that good) but because, just this last year, Larry Dodd retired from his position at UF. I was sad because this would have been a perfect addition to the Scope syllabus had he still been teaching it. But it has inspired me to keep better track of books like these so that, maybe someday, I’ll also be able to offer interested folks a suite of books that track the evolution of knowledge (both what we know and how we know) over my own career. I think it speaks very highly of this work that I think it has the potential to assist in cementing in others the same love of philosophy, science, and philosophy of science that Scope did for me.\nThough, if I ever get the chance, I promise that I’ll do my best to stay shy of 30-something pages5.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe age of the book may discourage some from picking it up. Honestly, though, I didn’t even know it was this old as I was reading it.. It honestly reads more like a book from the time of its release onto Audible (2017) than from nearly two decades prior. I’m not sure if that is a comment of Godfrey-Smith’s perspicaciousness as a writer (and his ability to distill arguments into their more “timeless” elements) or on the rate of change in the discussed fields. To take a page from his book—literally—it’s probably something in between.↩︎\nThough I did at times wonder if he was taking this argument a bit too far and, consequently, sparring with its straw man. I think he has a fair critique when he observes that theories and frames can strongly influence what we see but that their strength is fundamentally constrained by a shared external reality.↩︎\nI feel like a lot of the differences between contemporary empiricism, naturalism, and scientific realism tend to either be real but highly technical or largely imagined but wielded fiercely by invested practitioners. In either case, largely inconsequential for the lay reader.↩︎\nFor the curious, this could be articulated quite easily as someone merely having a larger degree of faith in the continuation of the status quo and in greater expressed uncertainties in alternatives to it.↩︎\nI solemnly swear: 25 pages max.↩︎\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{licari2022,\n  author = {Peter Licari and Peter Licari},\n  title = {Book {Review:} {Theory} and {Reality}},\n  date = {2022-11-07},\n  url = {www.peterlicari.com/posts/theory-reality-book-review},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPeter Licari, and Peter Licari. 2022. “Book Review: Theory and\nReality.” November 7, 2022. www.peterlicari.com/posts/theory-reality-book-review."

No state’s return is independent of the others—if Biden won Texas, that means we’re looking at a bona fide blue malestrom, let alone a wave—but some states give more information about how other states are going to break than others. FiveThirtyEight has a tool that uses the correlations among polling errors to show how a victory in some states ripples out to signal what’s happening in others. A Trump win in Georgia doesn’t shift things much, nor does one in Texas, because frankly it’s a shock that they’re even in play. A win in Florida, however, drastically lowers Biden’s chances and suggests a map that looks like the one above. However, even in that case, the President is still not favored to win if only for the fact that Biden is still leading in the Electoral college.\n\nThe upshot however is that if Trump loses any of those states, his only path to victory lies in there being large, unprecedented degrees of polling error.\nI know, I know. Some of you might be thinking: “But Peter! The polls in 2016…” to which I will reply (for what I pray to all that is good and holy is the last time) that even the state level polls did reasonably well in 2016 in the aggregate—and more pollsters have been doing more high quality state-level polls than last time. There have also been adjustments across the industry to account for the biggest systematic source of polling error in 2016, which was not properly accounting for Trump’s support among White, non-college educated voters."

(Georgia could be called first but that doesn’t necessarily mean that Florida will go with it; the leverage one state has over another is asymmetric. For example: North Carolina going red/blue means less for Texas’ eventual outcome than Texas going red/blue means for North Carolina.) Ohio will probably provide a good (but, again, not perfect) indication for how the other three states will break."

And it’s made all the tougher because he’s currently not favored in Pennsylvania. And by “not favored in Pennsylvania” I mean that The Economist is giving Biden a 95% chance of carrying the state. Trump will have to outperform the polls by a strong margin to carry the day. The most likely states, given the margin of error for the most recent state level polls, is Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine-2 and Nebraska-2. That will give Trump 270 votes in the Electoral College.\n\n\n\nBut I want to stress how unlikely that is. Many of these wins are not all that correlated with each other—meaning that a win in any of them early on doesn’t necessarily portend a Biden defeat. (Other state combinations are also possible, but we’d be talking about even less likely polling errors.)"

If the President wins there, it’s likely that he’s winning in a lot of other places that he’s currently not favored. However,it should be noted that even then he’d still need to pick up every one of the toss-up states. That can be helped by the fact that winning Pennsylvania would suggest a large degree of errors in the polls. But that degree of error is, I have to emphasize, really improbable. This outcome isn’t necessarily less likely than the one above, but pulling-off Pennsylvania would be an incredible upset. And, honestly, I would probably need to seriously reevaluate my life choices should it happen: especially my chosen profession.\n\n\n\nThe other point to consider when weighing out the importance of Pennsylvania is just how long that would make the contest. Basically, if Trump wins every toss-up state, then we’re not going to know the election’s outcome until about the end of the week at earliest. Because, as mentioned above, Pennsylvania counts their early votes last and haven’t started counting them at all. If Trump is ahead by the end of the night, we’ll just have to wait and see if the Biden advantage banked-up from early voting is enough. (Although, as a Floridian, I must confess that it’ll be nice to have all of the attention away from us for once.)\n\nIn short, in order for the President to win, he’s going to have to pull-off one helluva upset. That doesn’t make it impossible (upsets happen all the time) but, by definition, it makes it unlikely."
